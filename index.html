      <h1>General Information</h1>
        The universe of <i>The Witcher</i> is based on a medievel setting and is
        basically divided into two major fractions. First of all we got the
        <b>Northern Kingdoms</b> where most of the story takes place. These kingdoms
        might squwamble amongst each other most of the time but they also can
        stand together when <b>Nilfgaard</b>, the second big fraction in the universe
        threatens them with war.
