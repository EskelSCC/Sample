      <h1>General Information</h1>
        The universe of The Witcher is based on a medievel setting and is
        basically divided into two major fractions. First of all we got the
        Northern Kingdoms where most of the story takes place. These kingdoms
        might squwamble amongst each other most of the time but they also can
        stand together when Nilfgaard, the second big fraction in the universe
        threatens them with war.
