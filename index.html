      <h1>General Information</h1>
        The universe of The Witcher is based on a medievel setting and is <br>
        basically divided into two major fractions. First of all we got the <br>
        Northern Kingdoms where most of the story takes place. These kingdoms <br>
        might squwamble amongst each other most of the time but they also can <br>
        stand together when Nilfgaard, the second big fraction in the universe <br>
        threatens them with war.
